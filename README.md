# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction
A machine learning project predicting cardiovascular disease using Python.  
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease based on patient data. Created as part of an academic exploration, this project aligns with my background in food and clinical nutrition, with a focus on understanding and addressing cardiovascular health risks.

## Features
- Data preprocessing for handling missing values and scaling features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in the dataset.
- Implementation of machine learning models for classification.
- Model evaluation and selection based on accuracy and other metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- `Python 3.7+`
- `Jupyter Notebook` or `JupyterLab`
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rumana662/Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction.git
    cd Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Cardiovascular Disease Prediction.ipynb
    ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and train the models.

This is my first project, and I followed a guided approach for learning purposes. The notebook includes step-by-step workflows to explore the dataset and understand machine learning pipelines.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Cardiovascular Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) from Kaggle.  
Please download the dataset and save it in the `data` directory as specified in the notebook.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the dataset to uncover insights.
3. **Modeling**: Training and testing machine learning models to predict cardiovascular disease.
4. **Evaluation**: Comparing model performance using metrics such as `accuracy`, `precision`, `recall`, and `F1-score`.

### Models Used
The machine learning models used in this project include:
- `Logistic Regression`
- `Decision Trees`
- `Random Forest Classifier`
- `Support Vector Machines (SVM)`

The models were evaluated using standard metrics, with the notebook documenting their respective performances. Key insights and results can be found within the notebook.

## Results
The project highlights the potential of machine learning models in predicting cardiovascular diseases. Specific outcomes, such as accuracy percentages and feature importance rankings, are included in the notebook.

## Future Scope
- Add hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.
- Explore deep learning models for prediction.
- Expand the dataset for more robust insights.
